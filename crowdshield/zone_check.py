People on a balcony and people on the floor below can sit close together in a picture, yet they are
separate crowds in separate spaces. What gives them away is an empty band across the box: a railing, a wall,
a stretch with no heads. Boxes are for a person to draw, since a picture alone can't say where one space ends;
this says when they look wrong.
